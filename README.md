# Quantum
**Quantum dynamics solver**

---Diego Nicolas Bernal-Garcia---

Quantum is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems. The Quantum library uses the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and Cython packages as numerical backend, and graphical output is provided by Matplotlib. Quantum aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. Quantum is freely available for use and/or modification, and it can be used on all Unix-based platforms and on Windows. Being free of any licensing fees, Quantum is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research as well as in the classroom.


## REMARKS

**This version of Quantum pretends to replace the minimal qutip packages.**
