# Quantum
**Quantum dynamics solver**

---Diego Nicolas Bernal-Garcia---

Quantum is open-source software for calculating the dynamics of quantum systems. The Quantum library is strongly based and inspired by QuTip: Quantum Toolbox in Python. Copyright (c) 2011 and later, Paul D. Nation and Robert J. Johansson.
All rights reserved. It takes advantange of the Numpy, Scipy, and Cython packages, as well as Matplotlib.

Quantum differs from QuTip in two essencial features:
1. It allows truncation by excitation manifold for certain specific problems.
2. It uses the theory of Green operators to calculate the two-time correlation functions, as well as the density energy spectrum.

Quantum is freely available for use and/or modification.

## REMARKS

This version of Quantum pretends to replace the minimal QuTip packages.
