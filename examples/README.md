Quantum notebooks
===============

These files are [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) with different examples of usage of the Quantum library. Jupyter is easly installed in GNU/Linux.

To open these files, start a Jupyter notebook server by running the following command in the directory that contains the files:

    $ jupyter notebook
    
And then select the notebook files to use. 

Remarks
-------
Quantum uses many of the excellent Classes and Functions of QuTip. Nevertheless it allows to truncate the problem for an arbitrary selected basis of states.
